# Clean up processes if ran out of disk space or memory midway through kola tests.
# - There may be more items needing cleaning. This is just enough to get running
#   again if you ran out of space in /tmp or memory.
# - Be careful before running that there are no conflicts with other processes
#   or files that might be destroyed by running this script.

# Run 'df' and 'pa -a' before and after - should clear up kola-related processes
# and the /tmp folder.
